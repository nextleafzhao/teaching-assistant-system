Expand description

Due to the `Stream` trait’s inclusion in `std` landing later than Tokio’s 1.0 release, most of the Tokio stream utilities have been moved into the [`tokio-stream`][4] crate.

## §Why was `Stream` not included in Tokio 1.0?

Originally, we had planned to ship Tokio 1.0 with a stable `Stream` type but unfortunately the [RFC][5] had not been merged in time for `Stream` to reach `std` on a stable compiler in time for the 1.0 release of Tokio. For this reason, the team has decided to move all `Stream` based utilities to the [`tokio-stream`][4] crate. While this is not ideal, once `Stream` has made it into the standard library and the `MSRV` period has passed, we will implement stream for our different types.

While this may seem unfortunate, not all is lost as you can get much of the `Stream` support with `async/await` and `while let` loops. It is also possible to create a `impl Stream` from `async fn` using the [`async-stream`][6] crate.

## §Example

Convert a [`sync::mpsc::Receiver`] to an `impl Stream`.
[code] 
    use tokio::sync::mpsc;
    
    let (tx, mut rx) = mpsc::channel::<usize>(16);
    
    let stream = async_stream::stream! {
        while let Some(item) = rx.recv().await {
            yield item;
        }
    };
